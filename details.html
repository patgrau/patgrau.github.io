				<h3> Wednesday, March 29th </h3>
				<p> Optional Out of Town Guest Arrival #1 </p>
				<p> Pick up from airport and transportation to Hotel Hacienda San Martin </p>
				<h4>Excursion: Trip to Teotenango Pyramid</h4>
				<p>Trip departs from the hotel at 2:00 p.m. and returns to the hotel around 6:00 p.m.</p>
				<p class="description"> Visit this amazing site where the ruins of an ancient city and pyramid remain on top of Tetepetl  Hill. Built in 750 AD, Teotenango is a magnificent example of Mesoamerican engineering and workmanship. No one is sure who built Teotenango. The buildings, architecture, alignments, and carvings all indicate the city was purpose-built for celestial observation and religious ritual. It was only after the Matlatzinca occupied the city from around 1162 AD that the defensive walls and large residential complexes were added, thus transforming the ceremonial compound into a citadel. It is these defensive walls that give Teotenango its name, which roughly translates to “Place of the Divine Walls”. The last occupants were the Aztecs, who conquered the city and the surrounding region in 1474 AD, but they made no significant changes. <a href="http://uncoveredhistory.com/mexico/teotenango/">More info here</a> </p>
				<p class="tab"> Notes: This trip does require walking up a hill of about .75 miles to get to the ruins. Please remember Mexico City is much higher in altitude and this will be harder than you are used to. The pyramids themselves, if you want to climb them, have steep steps. Wear appropriate footwear and bring a jacket--it may be windy up there! Drive time to destination is approximately 30 minutes. Transportation and admission are covered. Please bring money for any food, drink or souvenirs you may want. </p>
				<p>Trip Guide(s): Patrick Grau</p>
				
				<p> Dinner will be at the San Martin Restaurant at your convenience. </p>

				<p> Optional Out of Town Guest Arrival #2 </p>
				<p> Check in at hotel and lunch </p>
				<h4> Excursion Option #1: Trip to Teotihuacan </h4>
				<p> Trip departs from hotel at 8:00 a.m and returns to the hotel around 6:00 p.m.</p>
				<p class="description"> Visit this most iconic ancient city in Mesoamerica. Little is known about Teotihuacan’s origins and how this enormous metropolis with its giant monumental structures came to be built so early in Mesoamerican history.  Its profound size and carefully aligned structures even perplexed the Aztec’s when they rediscovered the long abandoned city more than 1000 years after it was built. They named it Teotihuacan, meaning “Birthplace of the Gods” or the “Place where time began”. <a href= "http://uncoveredhistory.com/mexico/teotihuacan/">More info here</a> </p>
				<p class="tab"> Notes: This trip will likely involve a many steps and walking at a higher altitude than you are used to. Please wear appropriate footwear and bring a jacket. Drive time to destination is approximately 1.5 to 2 hours. Bring a book for the ride! Transportation is covered. Please bring money for admission, food, drinks, and souvenirs. </p>

				<h4>Excursion Option #2: Trip to Taxco</h4>
				<p>Trip departs from hotel at 8:00 a.m. and returns to the hotel around 6:00 p.m. </p>
				<p class="description"> Visit this ancient mining town which is characterized by its cobbled and winding lanes, traditional plazas and antique houses with elegant colonial facades. Due to the intense exploitation of its silver deposits, Taxco became one of the most important mining areas in the empire of New Spain. Today, in almost every corner of the town, you can find stores where locally-produced silver jewelry is sold. The best way to discover the beauty of this town and its surroundings is the cable car, which offers a scenic travel at more than 173 meters high. <a href="http://www.visitmexico.com/en/taxco">More info here</a> </p>
