				<h3> Takeshi "Tako" Elizalde</h3>
				<p> Call him Taco, yes like the food. Tako is an old high school friend of Patrick’s and always up for a good time. He works at Coca-Cola (so you know, Samantha’s dream job…wait, you don’t get to drink the product all the time for free? nevermind.). He recently got engaged (formally) to the love of his life--Karen, and they are getting married next November.</p>
			
				<h3> German “Grandpa” Muciño </h3>
				<p> German (pronounced with an H sound, like hair-MAHN, not German like the country in Europe and NOT Herman like Herman Munster) is a an high school friend of Patrick’s and lovingly referred to as Grandpa because he’s the oldest of the group. No? He’s not? Oh, it’s because he’s grumpy? I don’t know! German is married to Rosa and they have a beautiful new baby girl named Veronica who will be about 9 months old by the time our wedding rolls around. And he’s perfectly friendly, not at all grumpy. ;) </p>
			 	
				<h3> Jose Alberto Ramirez aka “Pat” </h3>
				<p> Yeah, I don’t get it either :) Pat is a great guy and old highschool friend of Patrick’s (who by the way, is called Garnacha by this group of people, so there’s no confusing the two). Pat is missing the actual wedding because he’s getting a new sister-in-law on the same day, but we forgive him anyway and we’re grateful for his help. Pat works somewhere doing something and is married to Barbara.</p>
		
				<h3> Guillermo “Memo” Perez </h3>
				<p> AMemo, often referred to as Niño (the boy), is also an old friend of Patrick’s and also works at Coca-Cola. He might love coke as much as me, maybe. He’s the only member of the group so far who isn’t whipped and prefers to remain free of romantic entanglements--for now *dumdumdummmm*</p>	
				
		
				<h3> Jorge Alberto Doria </h3>
				<p> Call him Doria because last names are better than first names? Doria just got a new job, so he doesn’t have any time off from work to be one of our tour guides, but we know he would if he could, but he will be supervising the carnita eating on Saturday! Doria is an avid triathlete and even does Ironman events. </p>
				
				<h3> Juan Ignacio Montesinos aka “Nacho” </h3>
				<p> Yes, Nacho. Like the cheese covered chips. Nacho went to highschool with all these other guys and is a non-practicing medical doctor and recently graduated with a Masters in Biotechnology and Entrepreneurship or something like that from John Hopkins. Now, he lives in the DC area and works doing something related to that, I’m assuming. </p>
