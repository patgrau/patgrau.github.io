		<h3> Hotel Information </h3>
		<h5> We have reserved a block of hotel rooms at <a href="http://www.haciendasanmartin.mx/">Hotel Hacienda San Martin</a> for our out of town 
			guests </h5>

		<h5> Rates are below: </h5>
		<h5> Master Suite (2 Available) $174/night </h5>
		<h5> Junior Suite (3 Available) $156/night </h5>

		<h5> We understand there may be some language barrier when making this transaction,
			if you would like Patrick or Samantha to make your reservation for you, we are MORE 
			than happy to do so. </h5> 	
		
		<h3> Air Travel </h3>
		
		<h5> Rather than attempting a group booking with just 1 airline, we are leaving your flight travel plans to you as we feel this will be much easier and more cost effective for everyone. <h5>
			
		<h5> We recommend using <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/"> Google Flights</a> or your favorite travel booking website. Don't forget to check <a href="https://www.southwest.com/">Southwest Airlines</a> as they don't post their prices on any travel sites. </h5>
		
		<h5> Studies I've read online say that the best time to buy tickets to Mexico is about 89 days prior to travel. Somewhere around 100 days before is the "sweet spot." </h5>	
			
		<h5> Once you have made your travel reservations, please let us know the details, so that we can coordinate your pick up from the airport. </h5>	
			
		<h3> Other Information </h3>
		
		<h5> For our out of town guests, we do recommend checking out the CDC travel guidelines for Mexico <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/children.vfr/mexico?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001">here.</a>		
		
		<h5> Patrick's basic recommendations include: Drink only bottled water, be cautious of ice from places that don't make it from bottled water, avoid raw fruits and veggies as these are washed in water, don't use Taxi cabs, stay together in groups. 
			
		<h5> You WILL need a passport to travel to Mexico. If you don't already have one, please apply well in advance. Also, check your passport's expiration date. Some countries will not let you leave/enter if your passport will expire in the next 6 months. For more information on passports click <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/passports.html">here.</a> </h5>
